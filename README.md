                                                            Run JavaScript 
Because of its wide range of 
applications, you can run 
JavaScript in several ways:
• Using console tab of web browsers
• Using Node.js
• By creating web pages
1. Using Console Tab of Web Browsers
2.  1. Open your browser and right click in any empty area and select inspect or press F12.
3. Open the developer tools and go to Console tab. Write the Javascript code and press Enter
                                                          2. Using Node.js
                                                        
Node is a back-end environment for executing JavaScript 
code. To run JS using Node.js, follow these steps:
1. Install the latest version of Node.js.
2. Open Visual studio code and create js file
3. Run node hello.js
4. See the result
                                                          3. By creating web pages
JavaScript was initially created to make web pages

                                                       JavaScript Variables and Constants
                                                       
In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them.
However, there are some differences between them. 
                                                       contstant
const keyword indicates that
the value of a variable is a 
constant ES6(ES2015).
scope is defined as 
'block scoped'
const
For example, const n

                                                 LOOP for
The for statement creates a loop that
consists of three optional expressions, 
enclosed in parentheses and separated by
semicolons, followed by a statement
(usually a block statement) to be
executed in the loop
                                              LOOP while
The while statement creates a loop that
executes a specified statement as long as
the test condition evaluates to true. The 
condition is evaluated before executing the
statement.
                                            LOOP Do/while
The do...while statement creates a loop
that executes a specified statement until
the test condition evaluates to false. The 
condition is evaluated after executing
the statement, resulting in the specified
statement executing at least once.
